## Course Description

GitHub Models is a great place for developers to experiment with large language models (LLMs), especially if you’re an Azure developer who’s looking to test an idea or prototype an application. Integrating GitHub Models with Azure allows you to move logic back and forth as you work through each phase of a project. In this course, instructor Rob Bos shows you how to create prototypes and development paths in GitHub Models and then scale them for deployment in Azure. Along the way, gather insights to help you leverage the power of planning and practice, shifting your attention away from the more constrained options of GitHub Models to the more open and flexible features offered by Azure. This course is an ideal fit for Azure developers looking for a quick start guide to GitHub Models.

## Instructions
The code files used in this course are available in the 'models' branch of this repository.
